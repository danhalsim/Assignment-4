# Project 4: Code Quiz

## Description

This is my fourth assignment project for the UCI Coding Bootcamp.

This website is a coding quiz in which the user is able to test their knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts. They are able to see their score in terms of how much time they have left by the end of the quiz. They are able to store this score on their local machine.

The purpose of this project website is to demonstrate the use of functions and logic in JavaScript, as well as the use of local storage to store user data.

Working on this project helped me learn how to create a website that is responsive to user input. It also helped me learn how to implement local storage in order to store the user's scores from the quiz.
